## What is this?  
This is a way to save and load presets of *Saved Chord Shapes* in webfishing :D  
  
Current hotkeys: press **f10** to open the add/selection gui, **f9** to kill the app   
and press **f8** to run the setup but you shouldnt need to do this at normal resolutions and aspect ratios (1080p, 1440p, 4k at 16:9 is the default)  
  
It also allows you to use the numpad to switch presets.  
  
This does not allow you to play songs automatically or with a MIDI device. Check [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3352573634) out if that's what you want.
