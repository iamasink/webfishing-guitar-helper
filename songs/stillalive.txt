# I'm making a note here: Huge success.
# WYTRR T / E RW
# It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.

# 
# Aperture Science.
# 1)YTRRT /
# We do what we must because we can.
# WYTRR TE RW
# For the good of all of us,
# R TY R2)E RT
# except the ones who are dead.
# WRT4)YTRE
# 
# But there's no sense
# 5)WER Y
# crying over every mistake.
# 4)TRREREE E
# You just keep on trying
# 5)WER Y
# 'till you run out of cake.
# 6)YTREERT T
# And the science gets done,
# Y7)TYY T R
# and you make a neat gun
# ERTT R E
# for the people who are still alive.

# As they burned it hurt because

# I felt so happy for you.
# WRT4)YTRE
# 
# Now these points of

# data make a beautiful line.
# 4)TRREREE E
# And we're out of
# 5)WER Y
# beta we're releasing on time.
# 6)YTREERT T
# So I'm glad I got burned,
# Y7)TYY T R
# think of all the things we learned
